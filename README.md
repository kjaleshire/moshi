Mosh - for catching all (well, most...) of your misspelled words.



Usage:
$ mosh [dictionary_path]
	where dictionary_path is the path to the custom word dictionary you wish to use
$ mosh -v
	print version
$ mosh -h
	print help

If no dictionary path is specified, mosh will use the built-in UNIX word list at /usr/share/dict/words. This list is quite long, however, so it may take a few seconds to load.

Once loaded, mosh will present you with a prompt like so:
>_

Type any word you wish to check and mosh will cheerfully spit out a list of recommendations.

Enjoy!

Mosh is short for もうしいれる (Moshireru): 'to propose, to suggest'
